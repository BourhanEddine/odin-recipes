        <h2>So you may wonder what is a lasagna ?</h2>
        <p>Lasagna is the name of one of the oldest and best-known pasta shapes. It is usually rectangular or ribbon shaped, thicker than tagliatelle, made from a dough based on flour and eggs, with numerous local variants. After being boiled, the rectangular lasagna noodles are drained and placed in layers with a filling that varies based on different local traditions. </p>
        <h2>Wondering how to make one ?</h2>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Cheese Filling: For this classic lasagna recipe, the filling contains ricotta and parmesan with seasonings and a couple of tablespoons of parsley. No ricotta? No problem, cottage cheese works just fine in this recipe!</li>
            <li>Meat: I use both Italian sausage and ground beef for great flavor. If using all beef, add a ¼ teaspoon of fennel seeds and some Italian seasoning to the meat mixture for flavor.</li>
            <li>Sauce: To keep this sauce quick, I use pasta sauce or marinara sauce (it’s easy to make from scratch with crushed tomatoes and canned tomatoes if you’d prefer).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Boil pasta:</strong> Cook in a large pot of salted water per the recipe below.</li>
            <li><strong> Prepare meat sauce:</strong> Cook sausage and beef with onion and garlic. Drain well, add the pasta sauce & simmer it for a few minutes to thicken.</li>
            <li><strong> Combine cheese mixture:</strong> Stir the cheese mixture together in a bowl.</li>
            <li><strong> Layer & bake:</strong> Layer the meat sauce and cheese mixture with lasagna noodles and bake until browned and bubbly.</li>
            <li></li>
        </ol>
