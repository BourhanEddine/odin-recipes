        Chicken tagine is a traditional Moroccan dish of chicken 
        braised with spices, garlic, onion, olives, and preserved
         lemons. It’s a company-worthy dish yet easy enough to 
         throw together on a not-too-busy weeknight. The word 
         tagine refers to the shallow clay vessel with a 
         cone-shaped lid in which the dish is traditionally 
         cooked, but you don’t need one to make it. I use a 
         large cast-iron braiser; a wide Dutch oven or heavy 
         covered skillet will work, too. This recipe, tweaked a 
         bit from Cook’s Illustrated, does not call for preserved
          lemons, a specialty ingredient that can be difficult 
          to find. Instead, lemon zest and fresh lemon juice add
           tart brightness to the dish. Serve the chicken on a 
           platter or individual plates over a bed of couscous.
